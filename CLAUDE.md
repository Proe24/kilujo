# kilujo — Project Notes for Claude

A small personal Astro site for **Gianna Yim**, **Stephen Underwood**, and their dogs **Kilo** (Shiba Inu) and **Kujo** (Jindo/Border Collie mix). Quiet, slow-paced, not a brand. Currently in Okinawa.

- **Live:** kilujo.com (and `www.kilujo.com`)
- **Repo:** github.com/Proe24/kilujo
- **Hosting:** Vercel — auto-deploys on every push to `main`.

---

## Workflow

The owner handles git. **Claude edits files locally; the owner runs `git add . && git commit && git push`.** Do not create commits unless explicitly asked.

```powershell
npm install        # one-time
npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321
npm run build      # static build → dist/
npm run preview    # serve the build locally
```

---

## Ground rules

1. **No secrets in the repo, ever.** API keys come from env vars only. Never inline, never commit `.env`, never log.
2. **Announce new env vars before push.** If a change introduces one, tell the owner clearly so it gets added to Vercel first — otherwise the next deploy breaks.
3. **Privacy by default.** No analytics, no third-party trackers, no external CDNs, no embedded social widgets unless the owner explicitly asks. Self-host anything that can be self-hosted (fonts via `@fontsource/*`, images via `public/uploads/`).
4. **Update docs when behavior changes.** Touch `README.md` for user-facing things; this file for how the project is operated.
5. **Tell the owner clearly when you change existing Astro files** — they want to know what to expect before pushing.
6. **The Barotrauma guide is a self-contained drop.** See the dedicated section below; don't restyle it to match the main site.

## Content model

Four editable surfaces, all defined in `.pages.yml` and `src/content/config.ts`:

### Journal (`src/content/journal/`)
Unified feed of **writing / video / gaming**. The `kind` field discriminates which extra fields apply:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `title`, `date`, `author`, `kind` | Required. `author` is `"Gianna Yim"` or `"Stephen Underwood"`. |
| `excerpt`, `cover`, `coverAlt`, `tags`, `gallery` | Optional, all kinds. |
| `youtubeId` | Only when `kind: video`. Just the ID (e.g. `wpQQxUeekks`), not the URL. |
| `game`, `rating` (1–5), `platform`, `hours` | Only when `kind: gaming`. |

The Astro schema (`src/content/config.ts`) uses a **Zod discriminated union** so invalid combinations fail at build time. Pages CMS sends them all as optional and we narrow on the kind.

### Projects (`src/content/projects/`)
Small things we've made — guides, experiments, tools. Drives `/projects`.

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `title`, `year`, `kind`, `status`, `blurb`, `link` | Required. `kind` ∈ {Guide, Experiment, Tool}. `status` ∈ {Live, In progress, Proof of concept, Archived}. |
| `tech`, `cover`, `accent`, `body` | Optional. `accent` is a hex string for the card's top stripe (default `#c08a6f`). |

`link` is either an internal path (e.g. `/guides/barotrauma/baro_index.html`) or an external URL. The Barotrauma guide is one project entry; its static files still live under `public/guides/barotrauma/`.

### Pages (`src/content/pages/`)
Single-file content. Two singletons today:

- **`about.md`** — rendered by `src/pages/about.astro` via `getEntry('pages', 'about')`. Fields: `title`, `hero`, `heroAlt`, body.
- **`home.md`** — drives the **"Now"** status card at the bottom of the home page. Fields: `nowMonth` (optional override, e.g. `"May 2026"` — defaults to the current month) and `nowBody` (the paragraph itself; leave blank to hide the whole card).

### Photos — *not* managed
Albums are pulled from **Flickr at build time** via `src/lib/flickr.ts` and rendered by `src/pages/photos/`. The CMS does not touch this — leave it alone.

---

## Authoring conventions

- **Bylines:** `author: "Gianna Yim"` (coffee posts so far) or `author: "Stephen Underwood"` (vlogs so far). Renders as "By {name}" on post pages.
- **Tags:** array on journal posts. Each generates `/journal/tag/<tag>`. Index shows a filter row when any exist.
- **YouTube:** `kind: video` + `youtubeId: "..."`. Rendered inline via `youtube-nocookie.com` (lowest-tracking variant — owner approved).
- **Images:**
  - Existing hand-migrated content: `public/uploads/journal/<post-slug>/01.jpg` (zero-padded for sort order).
  - New CMS uploads: flat in `public/uploads/journal/` (Pages CMS doesn't support per-entry subfolders).
  - Reference via `cover` (single string) and `gallery` (array of strings *or* `{ src, alt }` objects).
- **Markdown:** use straight ASCII apostrophes/quotes when writing or migrating content — easier round-tripping through CMS edits.

---

## Design system

The site uses the warm **"kilujo"** design (Claude Design handoff, May 2026):

- **Palette:** soft warm neutrals + terracotta accent. Tokens in `src/styles/global.css`:
  `--bg: #faf7f2`, `--bg-alt: #f1ece4`, `--text: #2f2a26`, `--muted: #76695f`, `--accent: #c08a6f`, `--border: #e6ddd1`.
- **Type:** italic **Newsreader** for display headings, **Iowan Old Style / Georgia** for body. Sans only for UI chrome (eyebrow labels, post meta, nav links).
- **Texture:** subtle SVG paper-grain + warm vignette on `body::before` / `body::after`.
- **Nav:** fixed at top, 64px tall, italic wordmark "kilujo." with terracotta dot. Five items: Home · Journal · Photos · Projects · About.
- **Shapes:** 14px corner radius on cards, soft drop shadows, rounded pill tags.
- **Dark mode:** CSS tokens defined under `[data-theme="dark"]`. No UI toggle wired yet — to test, set `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>`.
- **Wrappers:** pages provide their own `<div class="page"><div class="wrap">…</div></div>`. Three widths: `.wrap` (820px), `.wrap-wide` (1080px), `.wrap-narrow` (640px).

---

## Pages CMS

Config: **`.pages.yml`** at repo root. Four editable surfaces (Journal, Projects, Home — Now status, About), three named media stores (one per surface, all under `public/uploads/`).

- **Log in:** https://app.pagescms.org/ → Sign in with GitHub → authorize the `Proe24/kilujo` repo → click into it.
- Commits land on `main`. Vercel auto-rebuilds.
- **Pages CMS doesn't support conditional fields or dynamic per-entry image paths.** The kind-specific fields all show; the Zod schema is the actual guard. New CMS image uploads land flat (not in per-post subfolders).

---

## Env vars (set in Vercel)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FLICKR_API_KEY` | Build-time Flickr fetch for the Photos page. |
| `FLICKR_USER_ID` | Flickr NSID (e.g. `57829806@N07`). |

Local `.env` mirrors these for `npm run dev`/`build`. Gitignored.

---

## Barotrauma guide (`public/guides/barotrauma/`)

A self-contained static site living under `public/guides/`. **Treat as a sealed drop** — don't restyle it to match the main site. The dark "submarine" theme is intentional once you click in.

- **Single source of truth: `baro_nav.js`.** The `PAGES` array at the top of that file lists the hub, the playbook, and all 17 mod pages with their categories. Edit there and every page updates automatically.
- **Nav UX:** sticky topbar on every page with a back link to `/projects`, breadcrumb, position chip ("6 / 17"), and an "All mods" menu. The mod list is a **persistent right sidebar on viewports ≥ 1280 px**, and a **slide-in drawer below that breakpoint** (Esc / `/` / J / K shortcuts wired). Auto-injected prev/next at the bottom of every mod page.
- **To add a new page** in `public/guides/barotrauma/`: add the entry to the `PAGES` array in `baro_nav.js`, and include `<script defer src="baro_nav.js"></script>` before `</body>` in the new HTML file.

---

## Third-party embeds in use

| Embed | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **YouTube (youtube-nocookie.com)** | `/journal/<slug>` when `kind: video` | Lowest-tracking variant. Approved. |
| **Flickr static URLs** | `/photos` | Owner's own account; images served directly from `live.staticflickr.com`. |

Nothing else. No analytics, no fonts CDN, no widgets.

---

## Working preferences (carry these forward)

Inferred from the work to date — these will save back-and-forth:

- **Ask before structural changes.** Renaming nav items, restructuring collections, deleting routes — surface the choice first. Recommended option with one-line trade-off is welcomed.
- **State explicitly what existing files you're touching.** A table at the end of changes works well.
- **Default to recommendations marked clearly.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with a "(Recommended)" option when the answer matters.
- **Run a build after non-trivial changes** and confirm the page count + key routes generated. Spin up the preview server for visual changes; screenshots are welcome.
- **Keep commits batched.** The owner pushes after a logical chunk of work, not every small change.
- **Flag privacy implications.** If something introduces a third-party network call, call it out and offer a self-hosted alternative.
- **Don't fabricate content.** No placeholder posts under Gianna/Stephen's name — leave the section empty or use obviously-non-real demo data clearly labelled.
- **No emojis unless asked.** Plain prose, occasional `→` or `·` for typography.
- **Migrate dates carefully.** When a post date is ambiguous from source (e.g. `.docx` says "Aug 12" with no year), pick a reasonable default and flag it for the owner to confirm.

## Quick deploy steps (first push or domain changes)

1. Push to GitHub (`main`).
2. On Vercel: **New Project → Import** the repo. Astro is auto-detected.
3. Set `FLICKR_API_KEY` and `FLICKR_USER_ID` under Project Settings → Environment Variables.
4. Deploy. Every push to `main` triggers a rebuild.
